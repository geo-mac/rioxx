The format of this element **MUST** be an HTTP(S) URI which points to a related resource, e.g. a research dataset which underpins ***the resource***. An exception to this is the DOI identifying the related 'version of record' - this **MUST** be recorded in the *rioxxterms:version_of_record* element.

Each related resource **MUST** appear as a separate instance of the element.
